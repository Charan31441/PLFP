I have implemented simple "ipython" interpreter in python language (some part).

Please see the Screenshot enclosed with this folder which shows ipython interpreter in one terminal and current program output in other terminal.(They both look similar including colors :P)

Further Step:
Implementing interpreter for functions definations in program

PS: If you get error install python-termcolor
    (sudo apt-get install python-termcolor)
